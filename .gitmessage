# [AI/HUMAN] Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes
#
# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
# characters. The blank line separating the summary from the body is
# critical (unless you omit the body entirely).
#
# Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug"
# or "Fixes bug." This convention matches the commit messages generated
# by commands like git merge and git revert.
#
# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
#
# - Bullet points are okay, too
# - Use a hyphen or asterisk followed by a space
#
# If changes are AI-generated, start the commit message with [AI]
# If changes are human-generated, start with [HUMAN] or omit the prefix
#
# Reference issues and pull requests liberally
# e.g., Resolves: #123
#       See also: #456, #789
