<p>Tumblr introduced new default reblogging format. Added blockquotes for reblogged items might actually be cool from the point of view of ideology and semantics. But it is a total disaster for previously compact and lean layouts. Especially when blockquotes become multi-layer several-levels deeply-nested threads.</p>

<p>Ugh. Ugly.</p>
