<blockquote>
<p>But in a world where magazine are a lot more than their printed artifacts, what&rsquo;s a brand? I&rsquo;ll go through my evidence in a minute, but here&rsquo;s my current hypothesis. </p>

<p><b>Brands are probabilistic now. The primary power of a brand is to increase the probability that someone clicks on, upvotes, or links to a story associated with your brand.</b> It is not calculated primarily on a per issue basis as in the past. Instead, it&rsquo;s a kind of implicit regression based on all the stories a publication has produced.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a completely foreign idea. In the past, a brand&rsquo;s  strength would have been measured by how likely people were to buy or subscribe to a magazine. Today&rsquo;s probabilistic brand, though, is less 
coherent and much broader than before.</p>
