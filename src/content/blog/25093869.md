<p><a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/01/tumblr-growing-180k-users-720k-daily-pageviews.html">This Silicon Alley Insider article</a> discusses Tumblr’s recent growth. It’s currently getting over 700,000 page views per day, more than 2/3 of which go to actual tumblelogs. The rest are to the Tumblr homepage, the Dashboard, and other non-tumblelog pages. I probably check my Dashboard 20 times a day; there are no other sites I check regularly except Gmail and <a href="http://kottke.org/">Kottke</a>.</p>

<p>I imagine these numbers will just continue to grow as more people discover that maintaining your own blog is more satisfying than maintaining a profile on a social networking site. As I’ve said before, a comparison to being a homeowner vs. living in a housing project is appropriate.</p>

<p>The “Posts” statistic does not include stuff imported from feeds, as some users make their Flickr or Twitter streams import automatically. That’s 43,000 <i>manual</i> posts, every day - as <a href="http://bijansabet.com/post/25067228">fellow investor Bijan points out</a>, more than 1/3 of what Wordpress generates.</p>
