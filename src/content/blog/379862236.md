<blockquote>
<p><big>4. Design a treasure hunt. Forget the conventional or impersonal gifts. Designing a treasure hunt for your girl with a special note or gift at the end is one way of showing that you care enough to put in a lot of effort. You can make the hunt short or long, easy or hard. If you have known your geeky girl for long enough, use that history for some clue ideas. If the geeky girl is the type that likes to figure things out, she’ll love this idea.</big></p>

<p>10. Leave a little mystery. While geeky girls love to learn all about your interesting personality, it always helps to leave a little bit of mystery to keep them wanting more. Just make sure it’s not suspicious mystery; that could backfire.</p>

<p>Throughout it all, remember this: Geeks like to think. They like to be with people who think, especially those that have plenty of thought provoking conversations. Appeal to her intellect by displaying yours, but respect and cultivate her intellect in the process. Your efforts will be rewarded.</p>
