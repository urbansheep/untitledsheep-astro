<p>Just like <a href="http://ticklebooth.com/2007/01/watch-the-oscar-nominated-animated-shorts-online/">last year</a>, I have been able to find most of the Oscar nominated Animated shorts online. I have been generally happy with the Oscar nominations this year. However, I think <i>Atonement</i> deserved a best picture nomination (update: it did get nominated, what was I smoking?) and I think Kate Blanchett did NOT deserve a nomination for Elizabeth. The animated Oscar shorts nominees are quite strong. Certainly, a lot stronger than last year.</p>
