<blockquote>
WalMart is a better example of Enterprise 2.0 than any of these more trendy examples of user contribution systems. If Google&rsquo;s key innovation with PageRank was to recognize that a link was a vote which could be counted and measured to get better search results, so too WalMart recognized early on that a purchase was a vote. <strong style="font-size:1.4em;">Each company built real-time information systems to capture and respond to that vote.</strong> WalMart built a supply chain in which goods are automatically re-ordered as they go out the door with algorithms based on rate of sale controlling the reorders. Google built a better search engine in which pages that were &ldquo;better linked&rdquo; were given priority over the ones produced by pure keyword matches. They went on to build real-time systems to measure what John Battelle called the <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/000063.php">database of intentions</a> as expressed by people&rsquo;s queries and subsequent clickstream data as well as an ad auction system that prices ads in real-time based on the predicted likelihood of the ad being clicked on.
