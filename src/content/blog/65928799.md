<blockquote>
You could be more gracious than if you&rsquo;d won the work. You could send a thank you note for the time invested, you could sing the praises of the vendor chosen in your stead and you could congratulate the buyer, &ldquo;based on the criteria you set out, it&rsquo;s clear that you made exactly the right choice for your organization right now.&rdquo; That doesn&rsquo;t mean the criteria were right, it just means that you&rsquo;re not attacking the person for being an impulsive lunatic. You could even outline what you learned from the process and what you&rsquo;ll be changing in the future. And you can make it clear that you&rsquo;re in it for more than just a sale, and you&rsquo;ll be around if they ever need you.
