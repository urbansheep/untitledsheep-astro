<p>Developers would love to&nbsp;sell more copies of&nbsp;their game at&nbsp;a&nbsp;higher price, but the&nbsp;choices offered to&nbsp;gamers across XBLA, PSN, Steam, and&nbsp;other services have never been more extensive.</p>
<p><big>“Everyone has a&nbsp;queue in their head and a&nbsp;queue on their hard drive, and for most games, sales aren’t even a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;make sure your game gets played; they’re <em style="background-color:#ffffcc;">a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;move your game from a&nbsp;gamer’s mental queue to&nbsp;their hard drive queue,</em>”</big> — Ambrogi said.</p>
<p>“It could still, without hyperbole, be years before that person actually downloads, installs or plays your game.”</p>
