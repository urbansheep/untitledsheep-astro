<blockquote>
<p>Consider the following sentence: You and I should have lunch. Is the correct form of this sentence You and I &hellip; or You and me &hellip;? This is a common source of confusion in English.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there&rsquo;s an easy way to decide whether to use I or me in such sentences. All you have to do is drop the word you then try the sentence with I and me one at a time. For example: I should have lunch.
Me should have lunch.</p>

<p>Clearly the preferred form in this case is I; thus, the original sentence was correct to use you and I. Here&rsquo;s another example: He&rsquo;ll blame you and I. Drop the word you then try the sentence with I and me one at a time, like so: He&rsquo;ll blame I. He&rsquo;ll blame me.</p>

<p>You can see that the second of these is correct. This means that the original sentence should have been: “He&rsquo;ll blame you and me.” Easy.</p>

<p>On a related note, when using phrases such as you and me, you and I or them and us, it has traditionally been considered courteous to place the reference to yourself last. For example, we prefer: “He&rsquo;ll ask you and me later.” over: “He&rsquo;ll ask me and you later.”</p>
