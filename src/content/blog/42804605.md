<blockquote>
<p>If negative news is reported in China, such as a horrific crime or natural disaster, it ends the broadcast with an uplifting message about what the Chinese government has done to step in and help victims or survivors.</p>

<p><strong>This gives the viewer a sense of security and reliance and faith in the government.</strong> I donâ€™t ever recall feeling that way after watching American news broadcasting. In American news broadcasting, I get the daily sense that the world is coming to an end tomorrow and all hell is breaking loose. The more news I watch, the less sense of security and reliance and faith in the government I feel. <strong style="font-size:1.4em;">No wonder the Chinese people seem to love their government and we Americans seem to hate ours.</strong></p>
