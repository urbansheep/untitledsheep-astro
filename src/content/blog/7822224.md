<blockquote>
<p>The trick to novel writing is maintaining faith in yourself as a writer and of the importance of what you are doing. You have a lifetime of conditioning to fight, which will keep telling you that you are wasting your time putting hundreds of hours into something you may never get paid for.</p>

<p>Another voice will snidely remind you of all the novels uncompleted, and all the completed novels unpublished, and all the published novels unsuccessful. Another will tell you that the very stuff of your being is unworthy, your soul too thin and your brain too thick.</p>

<p>These voices are not yours &ndash; they&rsquo;re the echoes of the status quo, ground in by endless repetition. You can fight them with a good argument or you can get a partial lobotomy.</p>
