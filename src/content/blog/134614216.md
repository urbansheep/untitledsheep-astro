<p>Military term for an operation in which multiple things have gone wrong. Related to &ldquo;SNAFU&rdquo; (Situation Normal, All Fucked Up&quot;) and &ldquo;FUBAR&rdquo; (Fucked Up Beyond All Repair).</p>

<p>In radio communication or polite conversation (i.e. with a very senior officer with whom you have no prior experience) the term “clusterfuck” will often be replaced by the NATO phonetic acronym “Charlie Foxtrot.”</p>
