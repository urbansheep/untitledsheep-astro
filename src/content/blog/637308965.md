<p>“PALO ALTO, CA—All 1,472 employees of Facebook, Inc. reportedly burst out in uncontrollable laughter Wednesday following Albuquerque resident Jason Herrick&rsquo;s attempts to protect his personal information from exploitation on the social-networking site.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, he&rsquo;s clicking &lsquo;Friends Only&rsquo; for his e-mail address. Like that&rsquo;s going to make a difference!&rdquo; howled infrastructure manager Evan Hollingsworth, tears streaming down his face, to several of his doubled-over coworkers. &ldquo;Oh, sure, by all means, Jason, 'delete&rsquo; that photo. Man, this is so rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to internal sources, the entire staff of Facebook was left gasping for air minutes later when the &ldquo;hilarious&rdquo; Herrick believed he had actually blocked third-party ads.”</p>
