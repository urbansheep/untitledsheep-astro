<blockquote>
Customer communities are more sterile, homogenized and veneer than they will be in the future. When people seeking support, sales, partner, developer and media conversations intersect primarily with one part of the organization that has its own goals and measurements — you have an elephant trying to fit through a keyhole and <strong>nobody knows who has the key.</strong>
