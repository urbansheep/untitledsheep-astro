<blockquote>
<p>it&rsquo;s a synthetic combination of the words beauty and usage, and describes the beauty that comes with using something.</p>

<p>How, you may ask, is beausage any different than patina? Well, it&rsquo;s certainly related, but different. Patina is really more about surface level changes happening at a chemical level: oxidation, chemical stripping, and so on. Beausage describes changes that happen in 3D where atoms get torn and stripped away, as occurs with scratches, tears, chips, and wear marks. I used to say &ldquo;patina&rdquo; when what I really meant was &ldquo;beausage&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s nice to have both.</p>

<p>I wish I could say I coined it, but the term beausage is the brainchild of <a href="http://www.rivendellbicycles.com/html/about.html">Grant Petersen</a>, grand pooh-bah of <a href="http://metacool.typepad.com/metacool/2004/04/rivendell_bicyc.html">Rivendell Bicycle Works</a> and probably the single most brilliant, holistic, and intuitive brand creator out there. I mention Grant not only for intellectual attribution, but because he&rsquo;s going to help us bring this back into the world of creating cool stuff. Grant states that <em>&ldquo;In general, real materials develop beausage</em>, and synthetics look like old junk. It&rsquo;s like a cowpokes&rsquo;s old denim jacket, versus an old polyester leisure suit&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
