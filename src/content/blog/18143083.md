Mark I.: Incidentally, I came across a filtering rule for email that has completely eliminated all the Russian spam I used to get.
Mark I.: Matches: (в OR и) Do this: Skip Inbox, Delete it
Mark I.: If I got legitimate Russian mail, that wouldn’t work. But since I don’t speak Russian anyhow, I figure I’m safe. :)
Jamis B.: lol, awesome
