<p>io9 <a href="http://io9.com/5911520/a-chart-that-reveals-how-science-fiction-futures-changed-over-timew">пишет об исследовании</a> того, как изменялось представление о будущем в фантастике на протяжении десятилетий:</p>

<p>In general, <strong>the future got closer at the end of the twentieth century</strong>. You can see a gradual trend in this chart where after the 1940s, near-future SF grows in popularity. Again, this might reflect rapid technological change and the fact that SF entered mainstream popular culture.</p>

<p><strong>The future is getting farther away from us right now.</strong> One of the only far-future narratives of the 1990s was <em>Futurama</em>. Then suddenly, in the 2000s, we saw a spike in far-future stories, many of them about posthuman, postsingular futures. It&rsquo;s possible that during periods of extreme uncertainty about the future, as the 00s were in the wake of massive economic upheavals and 9/11, creators and audiences turn their eyes to the far future as a balm.</p>
