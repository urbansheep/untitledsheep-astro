<blockquote>
<p>Rich ideas: &hellip; Which is why, although it&rsquo;s just playing with words, I prefer to think about Rich Ideas. Richard Huntington describes this kind of idea as &lsquo;generous&rsquo; meaning it&rsquo;s something that every agency and partner around the brand management table doesn&rsquo;t just 'get&rsquo;, they can immediately think of a dozen great ways to bring it to life in their particular medium.</p>

<p>A Rich Idea might have instant appeal but it also has hidden depths, emotional resonance, inherent drama. If a Big Idea is like a high concept movie then a Rich Idea is like the premise for a soap opera or a series. It implies some development, some unfolding over time, some mystery.</p>

<p>Those high concept movies didn&rsquo;t spawn a load of interesting sequels because they were so thin, the cinematic equivalents of one-liners, but a simple premise like the one for Buffy The Vampire Slayer — high-school as horror movie — conjours up an entire imaginary universe, one which its fans are still exploring. <strong style="font-size:1.4em;">Give a good digital agency something like that to play with and they&rsquo;ll do something magical, give them the average advertising idea and they&rsquo;ll do a stupid flash game.</strong></p>
