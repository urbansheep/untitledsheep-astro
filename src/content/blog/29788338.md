<p>“Wal*Mart Country”</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://mills.tumblr.com/post/29753349">mills</a>:</p>
<p>From <a href="http://frankb.tumblr.com/post/29752029">frankb</a>. I have to see these all the time; I don’t like it, but I understand that believers have their property and their rights, etc. Indeed, I’d rather see big crosses than big Wal*Marts.</p>  <p>I think it would be funny to see the paroxysms of rage most Tumblrs would experience if they set foot in Baton Rouge, where entry into the city via I-10, from the east, is met with these three enormous crosses: “Welcome to Jesus Country!” That you can see them from the Super Wal*Mart parking lot is icing on the weirdo-cake.</p> <p>I think they’re probably trying to scare away us New Orleanians. </p>
