<blockquote>
The trick is to have everybody participating in the decision and make sure everybody has been heard. The book Wisdom of Crowds (by James Surowiecki) says that you have to have two things to make better decisions in groups. One is <strong>you need a deadline</strong>, which someone &ndash; at the end of the day is me or some external factor, and the second is that <strong>you need a dissident.</strong> There needs to be one person who will sit there in the room and say I disagree, and then the person next to him or her will say, &ldquo;Well, yeah.&rdquo; See, everyone waits for the first person to be the dissident, and then they pile on, and that&rsquo;s how you have a healthy argument.
