<blockquote>
<p style="font-size:1.2em;">The street as platform</p>
<p>We canâ€™t see how the street is immersed in a twitching, pulsing cloud of data. This is over and above the well-established electromagnetic radiation, crackles of static, radio waves conveying radio and television broadcasts in digital and analogue forms, police voice traffic. This is a new kind of data, collective and individual, aggregated and discrete, open and closed, constantly logging impossibly detailed patterns of behaviour. <strong>The behaviour of the street.</strong></p>
