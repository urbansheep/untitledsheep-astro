<h3>The Ultimate Rejection Letter</h3>
<p>
Herbert A. Millington<br/>
Chair - Search Committee<br/>
412A Clarkson Hall, Whitson University<br/>
College Hill, MA  34109</p>
<p>Dear Professor Millington,</p>
<p>Thank you for your letter of March 16.  After careful consideration, I regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your refusal to offer me an assistant professor position in your department.</p>
<p>This year I have been particularly fortunate in receiving an unusually large number of rejection letters.  With such a varied and promising field of candidates, it is impossible for me to accept all refusals.</p>
<p>Despite Whitson&rsquo;s outstanding qualifications and previous experience in rejecting applicants, I find that your rejection does not meet my needs at this time.  Therefore, I will assume the position of assistant professor in your department this August. I look forward to seeing you then.</p>
<p>Best of luck in rejecting future applicants.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>
Chris L. Jensen</p>
