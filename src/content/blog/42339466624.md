<blockquote><p>The times displayed on Grand Central’s departure boards are wrong — <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/02/the-clocks-at-grand-central-station-are-permanently-wrong/272768/">by a full minute</a>:</p>

<blockquote><div>This is permanent. It is also purposeful.

The idea is that passengers rushing to catch trains they’re about to miss can actually be dangerous — to themselves, and to each other. So conductors will pull out of the station exactly one minute after their trains’ posted departure times.

You might call this time-hacking; you might call it behavioral engineering; you might call it comical. Regardless, it seems to be working. Grand Central boasts the fewest slips, trips, and falls of any station in the country.</div></blockquote>

<p>Once heard <a href="http://www.carnegiehall.org/">Carnegie Hall</a> starts their performances eight minutes early [or late] for a similar reason. Curious what other time hacks exist to accommodate New Yorkers.</p>
