<p><h2>Idea: Random Wiki Story</h2>

<ol><li>Open 4 or more browser tabs, and load a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random"><strong>Random Wikipedia Page</strong></a> in each </li>
<li>Read (at least) the introduction for each article</li>
<li>Make notes and think about connections, characters, and conflicts</li>
<li>Write a one page fiction story inspired by the articles</li>
</ol><p>I’d originally done the tab thing as a way to try and learn something new and esoteric each day. But most times I do it, I find myself unintentionally making a story out of the random articles. Which seemed insane until I had this other idea.</p>

<p>Anyhow, might inspire me to try a bit of fiction, just for fun. If nothing else it seems like a nice warm-up exercise to nimble up the fingers and the brain.</p>
