<p>Along with hovercars, hoverboards, and robot slaves, video-chatting is one of the four harbingers of the Future, as foretold in basically every sci-fi book or movie ever made. So far it’s the only one we’ve figured out, and, honestly, it’s kind of a bust.</p>

<p>No one wants to sit there politely staring at their grandma’s furrowed brow while she spends 20 minutes pecking out “Are yo waering the sweter i sdent?” when they could be watching porn and smoking a bong at the same time. That’s the whole reason we came up with “chatting” in the first place. The only thing those little webcams are good for is cybering. Seeing boobs. Badgering girls for hours and hours until they take their shirts off. We asked our photo editor Patrick O’Dell to get some of his lady friends to try on some lingerie for his vid-cam in the name of “fashion.” (But it was all about tits.)</p>
