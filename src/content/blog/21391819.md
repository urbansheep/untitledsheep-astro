<p>The game is called <a href="http://setgame.com/set/rules.htm">Set</a>. You put out 12 from the deck. Everyone crowds around and tries to identify sets of three where “each feature is either the same on all of the cards, or different on all of the cards”. If you correctly identify a set, you get a point, the three cards are removed, and another three are added. It requires extreme concentration.</p>
