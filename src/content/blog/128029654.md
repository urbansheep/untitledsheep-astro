<blockquote>
<p>Four different tests of 63 people found that those who kept their intentions private were more likely to achieve them than those who made them public and were acknowledged by others.</p>

<p>Once you’ve told people of your intentions, it gives you a “premature sense of completeness.”</p>

<p>You have “identity symbols” in your brain that make your self-image. <strong>Since both actions and talk create symbols in your brain, talking satisfies the brain enough that it “neglects the pursuit of further symbols.”</strong></p>
