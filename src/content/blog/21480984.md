<p>You have to look closer to see what truly makes the models special, though, what elevates them above Victoria’s Secret: <em>they have wrinkles around their eyes</em>. These women have laugh lines, taut necks, and that slight tummy that can be so, so sexy. These are not the airbrushed dolls of ignorant fantasy. These women are real.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Now, these are special swimsuits, for real women. They slim and wrap. They emphasize and detract. These are the suits that populate the memories of men who know. These are the patterns and shapes of all-inclusive vacations and honeymoons. These are the suits of vibrant, sandy memories, of salt on skin and the unexpected pleasure of peeling back spaghetti straps to rub lotion into her exposed back, her head turned to the side, drifting asleep beneath your warm hands.</p>

<p>I hate you, Lands’ End.</p>
