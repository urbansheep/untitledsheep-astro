<blockquote>
It’s not easy to sum the Grim Fandango up in three words; with Full Throttle or Monkey Island for instance, you can just say, ‘It’s about bikers!’ or ‘It’s about pirates!’ The best I could do when pitching Grim to my friends was to say, <strong>‘It’s, like, a murder mystery, except where everyone starts out dead.’</strong> If that got their attention, I could delve into the Mexican folkloric elements and film noir sensibilities until their eyes started to glaze over. I’m not sure I have an answer apart from Grim just being a complex game.
