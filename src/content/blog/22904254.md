<blockquote>
Space Invaders was the first arcade game to work it&rsquo;s way out of seedy arcades and into pizza parlors and ice cream shops. The Space Invaders phenomenon stuned conservative adults who were certain the games soured the minds of their youngsters. Residents of Mesquite, Texas pushed the issue all the way to the Supreme Court in their efforts to ban the illicit machines from their Bible-belt community. The game was so amazingly popular in Japan that it caused a coin shortage until the country&rsquo;s Yen supply was quadrupled. Entire arcades were opened in Japan specifically for this game. Space Invaders was released in Japan for the Super Famicom, to my knowledge its the same thing as Space Invaders for Super Gameboy. <big>Many incidents of juvenile crime surrounded the release of this game. A girl was caught stealing $5000 from her parents and gangs of youths were reported to have robbed grocery stores just so they would have money to play the game.</big>
