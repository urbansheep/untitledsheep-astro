<blockquote>Generally speaking, I am not a fan of the meta. It’s seductive in a way that is subtly but deeply dangerous. It’s far easier to introspect and write about the process of, say .. blogging .. than it is to think up, research, and write about an interesting new topic on your blog. Meta-work becomes a reflex, a habit, an addiction, and ultimately a replacement for real productive work. It’s something I think everyone should watch out for, whatever walk of life or career you happen to have. In fact, I’ve come up with a zingy little catch phrase to help people remind themselves, and their coworkers, how toxic this stuff can be — <strong>meta is murder</strong>.</blockquote>
