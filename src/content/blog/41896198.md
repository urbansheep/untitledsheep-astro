<p style="font-size:1.4em;">The Four Principles Of Social Computing In Business</p>

<p><strong>Whoever comes are the right people</strong> — this is meant to alert the participants to the fact that whoever attends a session is &ldquo;right&rdquo; simply because they care to be there.</p>

<p><strong>Whatever happens is the only thing that could have</strong> — this is meant to tell the attendees to pay attention to what is going on at the moment, instead of worrying about what could possibly be.</p>

<p><strong>Whenever it starts is the right time</strong> — clarifies that there is no given schedule or structure and emphasises creativity and innovation.</p>

<p><strong>When it&rsquo;s over, it&rsquo;s over</strong> — to tell the participants not to waste time, but move on to something else when the fruitful discussion is over.</p>
