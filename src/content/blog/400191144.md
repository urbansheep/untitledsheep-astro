<blockquote>
<p>This sociability has helped Karp exploit Gotham&rsquo;s chattering classes: Tumblr has an estimated one-fifteenth the users of Wordpress.com, but generates about five time as much content, thanks to social networking tools that let its Brooklyn-centric userbase easily quote and snark upon one another&rsquo;s posts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Karp, in full bragging mode today, tells us Tumblr averages &ldquo;five interactions (answers, likes, reblogs, etc.) with each post on average versus 1.5 for Wordpress.&rdquo; That doesn&rsquo;t mean Tumblr is worth $15 million — it has yet to launch its &ldquo;really sexy&rdquo; plan to generate actual revenue — but it is an interesting stat, and a testament to the social networking features the snuggly young entrepreneur has built into his site. It&rsquo;s also a pretty solid indication Karp will soon have some additional &ldquo;interactions&rdquo; fairly soon, with surly young Mullenweg.</p>
