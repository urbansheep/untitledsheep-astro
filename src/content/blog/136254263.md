<blockquote>
<h2>Слово дня: “Op-Ed”</h2>
<p>An <strong>op-ed</strong>, abbreviated from <strong>opposite the editorial page</strong> (though often believed to be abbreviated from <strong>opinion-editorial</strong>), is a newspaper article that expresses the opinions of a named writer who is usually unaffiliated with the newspaper&rsquo;s editorial board. These are different from editorials, which are usually unsigned and written by editorial board members. Op-eds are so named because they are generally printed on the page opposite the editorial.</p>

<p>Although standard editorial pages have been printed by newspapers for many centuries, the first modern op-ed page was created in 1921 by Herbert Bayard Swope of <i>The New York Evening World</i>. When he took over as editor in 1920, he realized that the page opposite the editorials was &ldquo;a catchall for book reviews, society boilerplate, and obituaries.&rdquo; He is quoted as writing:</p>

<blockquote><p>“It occurred to me that nothing is more interesting than opinion when opinion is interesting, so I devised a method of cleaning off the page opposite the editorial, which became the most important in America&hellip; and thereon I decided to print opinions, ignoring facts.”
