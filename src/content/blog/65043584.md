<p><h3>A portfolio of fun</h3>
<p>One of my favorite aspects of this method is that you end up with a mini-portfolio of game design ideas. Instead of putting all the design risk in a project on one or two unproven mechanic, the team now has a half dozen or more proven bits of fun to build upon. If some don’t fit into the game or get abandoned for other reasons, that’s alright. You can afford to lose a few and the end product will still be fun. Think of it as designing from a position of plenty.</p>
