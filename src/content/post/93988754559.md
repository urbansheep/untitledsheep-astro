<blockquote>
<p>Taking the time to write at turning points in your life becomes really valuable over time. Looking through old essays recently, I realised that at each major point in the last ~5 years, I’d recorded my actions and reasons. It’s interesting to re-read yourself as a stranger — to see what’s changed, what’s faded away.</p>

<p>In the moment it’s just an update. In retrospect it’s a guided tour.</p>
