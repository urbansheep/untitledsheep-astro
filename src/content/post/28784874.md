<p><a href="http://tuneage.tumblr.com/post/28775464">tuneage</a>: We <a href="http://tuneage.tumblr.com/post/27014436">linked to</a> SXSW’s music showcase a few weeks ago. Even if you’re not going to (or already at) SXSW, it’s a great way of finding new music. But even for us, that’s a lot of music to look through.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/">Paul Ford</a>. In this article for The Morning News, he downloads and listens to all 763 tracks offered by the SXSW people and gives them a rating out of 5, and reviews them in six words. (Unrelated: He also writes <a href="http://twitter.com/ftrain">six word Twitter updates</a>.) As well as the reviews, there are also a number of charts, like rating distribution (average rating was 2.42 out of 5) and genre distribution, and other fun statistics, like all the bands with “ghost” or “fish” in their name, and various other things. They’re refreshing interludes in a list 763 items long.</p>

<p>If SXSW’s showcase was a good way of finding new music, this is a <em>great</em> way of finding new music.</p>
