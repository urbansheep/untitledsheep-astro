<blockquote>
It&rsquo;s just…you&rsquo;re like my best friend, and I would hate for something you desperately want to change that. I mean, sure, we could go on some dates, maybe mess around a little and finally validate the six years you&rsquo;ve spent languishing in this platonic nightmare, but then what? <strong>How could we ever go back to the way we were, where I take advantage of your clear attraction to me so I can have someone at my beck and call? <big>That part of our friendship means so much to me.</big></strong>
