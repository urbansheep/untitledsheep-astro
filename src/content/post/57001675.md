<blockquote>
The characteristics of most companies, in my observation, is that you don&rsquo;t have a lot of buy-in. The decisions are top down or they&rsquo;re driven from some external thing. People are like, “Oh, screw that, they don&rsquo;t really buy in.” But a decision-making process that is a sum of its iterative process, which is how Google works, generates commitment and passion that makes my job very easy.
