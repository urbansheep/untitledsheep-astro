<blockquote>
<p>“Count” Victor Lustig was a con man of considerable note. Born in 1890, by the 1930s he was wanted by approximately 45 law enforcement agencies worldwide. He had 25 known aliases and spoke 5 languages. He cunningly gained $5k from Al Capone. Better still, in 1925, Lustig posed as a government official in Paris, took five businessmen on a tour of the Eiffel Tower, and then &ldquo;sold&rdquo; it to one of them as 7300 tonnes of scrap metal; the con went so well, he tried it again soon after.</p>

<p>He also wrote the following list of commandments for aspiring con men.</p>

<ol><li>Be a patient listener (it is this, not fast talking, that gets a con-man his coups).</li>
<li>Never look bored.</li>
<li>Wait for the other person to reveal any political opinions, then agree with them.</li>
<li>Let the other person reveal religious views, then have the same ones.</li>
<li>Hint at sex talk, but don’t follow it up unless the other fellow shows a strong interest.</li>
<li>Never discuss illness, unless some special concern is shown.</li>
<li>Never pry into a person’s personal circumstances (they’ll tell you all eventually).</li>
<li>Never boast. Just let your importance be quietly obvious.</li>

<li>Never be untidy.</li>
<li>Never get drunk.</li>
</ol>
