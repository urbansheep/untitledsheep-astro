<blockquote>
<p>At Davos, Mark told the story of an art class he took at Harvard. He was busy starting Facebook and didn&rsquo;t have time to attend the class or study. The final exam was a week away and he was worried about flunking. So he went to the Internet and downloaded images of all the art that he knew would be on the exam (not sure how he knew that - Jeff leaves that part out). He puts them all up on a web page and adds blank boxes under each of them. Then he emails the web page to all of his classmates and tells them he just put up a study guide. The class responds by marking up the page, editing each other, and getting it perfect. Zuckerberg aces the exam, of course, <strong style="font-size:1.4em;">but also the professor told him that the entire class had done much better than usual on the exam.</strong></p>

<p>I like this story because it shows the value of public interaction. Yes, Mark in classic Tom Sawyer fashion got them to do his work for him, but they also got better as a group. They did it together.</p>
