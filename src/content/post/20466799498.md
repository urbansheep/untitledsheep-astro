<blockquote>
<p>Post-divorce, the Internet has become a personal minefield. There was the time shortly after the split when LinkedIn suggested I connect with my ex&rsquo;s new boyfriend. There was a time when Facebook kept surfacing &ldquo;remember this moment?&rdquo; photos of me and my ex from my mom&rsquo;s profile. I hid and changed my relationship status in the dead of night so as few people as possible would notice the change and ask me about it.</p>

<p>Worst of all is Gmail, which has one of the most maddening &ldquo;features&rdquo; to confront anyone going through a breakup. Nearly every time I wrote an e-mail to friends this past year, Gmail oh-so-helpfully suggested I include my ex-wife in the e-mail. And you can&rsquo;t turn this off. It still happens, despite my pleas to Google to make it optional. (Google obviously doesn&rsquo;t employ enough divorcees.)</p>
