<blockquote>
Flickr, for instance, has the rub of patina about it. Flickr&rsquo;s full of people and they show you evidence of those people all the time. It feels worn into place by millions of clicks rather than imposed from above by a capricious design god. And it shows you your own usage, it moulds itself to you, so it gets as familiar as an old fountain pen. Sort of. Equally there are web places that more, well, wipe-clean â€” loads of people there but you never see any evidence of them.
