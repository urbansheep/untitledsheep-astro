<blockquote>
<p><strong>The blame of bad performance or memory consumption no longer lies with the browser but with the site.</strong></p>

<p>By implementing this feature a browser is completely deflecting all memory or performance criticism off to individual site owners (&ldquo;Yikes, my browser is using 300MB of memory! Actually it&rsquo;s just youtube.com consuming 290MB of it, they should fix their web site!&rdquo;). This is going to be a monumental shift in the responsibilities of web developers â€” and one that will serve the web better, as a whole.</p>
