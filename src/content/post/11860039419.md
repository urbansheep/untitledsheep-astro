<blockquote>
<p>Most partnerships don&rsquo;t end up in court.</p>

<p>Most friendships don&rsquo;t end in a fight.</p>

<p>Most customers don&rsquo;t leave in a huff.</p>

<p>Instead, when one party feels underappreciated, or perhaps taken advantage of, she stops showing up as often. Stops investing. Begins to move on.</p>

<p>No, I&rsquo;m not going to sue you. Yes, I&rsquo;ll probably put my best efforts somewhere else.</p>

<p>Just because there are no firestorms on the porch doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re doing okay. More likely, there are relationships out there that need more investment, quiet customers who are unhappy but not making a big deal out of it. They&rsquo;re worth a lot more than the angry ones.</p>
