<blockquote>
I think this captures exactly what makes these ultra-complex shows (“<a href="http://thewire.wikia.com/wiki/The_Wire_on_HBO">The Wire</a>” being the other canonical, non-sci-fi example) so different from what has come before them on television: <strong>if you&rsquo;re trying to synthesize the entire history of the show, the proper form for conveying all that information is not a linear narrative. It&rsquo;s a relational database.</strong>
