<blockquote>
The beatings will continue until morale improves.
</blockquote>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_beatings_will_continue_until_morale_improves">“The beatings will continue until morale improves” is a famous quotation</a> of unknown origin. It literally denotes how morale, such as within a military unit or other hierarchical environment, will be improved through the use of punishment. More importantly, the phrase is used sarcastically to indicate the counterproductive nature of such punishment or excessive control over subordinates such as staff in the workplace or children living at home.”
