<blockquote>
<p>When people have created an account with one of our products, they should shed a tear because the experience is over. They should write ballads and march from town to town reading them to anyone who&rsquo;ll listen. They should hang signs from highway overpasses proclaiming our good name, hold 3-day block parties and call up radio stations to dedicate cheesy songs.</p>

<p>They should obsess.</p>
<p>Most of all, they should tell their friends about us. And if those friends don&rsquo;t sign up for our services they should go find new friends, because who needs unsupportive friends?</p>
