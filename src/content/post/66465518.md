<blockquote>
<h3>Day 9</h3><p>My girlfriend informs me that there&rsquo;s a black widow nesting in a drainpipe near our garage. I have now been on the GTD program for several days and am a next-action machine. I say out loud to myself in a robot voice, &ldquo;Processing &hellip; dot dot dot &hellip;&rdquo; I head outside, already planning my next action: &ldquo;Pour water down drain to send spider on river rampage to Jesus.&rdquo; On the way, however, I discover a dead squirrel. Protocol interrupted. How do you dispose of a dead squirrel?</p>
