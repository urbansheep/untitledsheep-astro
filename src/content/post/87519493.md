<blockquote>
<p>The paradox of transparency is that it may indeed reveal waste, fraud, and malfeasance, making things appear worse before they begin to get better. This is not something to be afraid of. It&rsquo;s a sign of success. [&hellip;]</p>

<p>We need a bipartisan commitment to transparency. It&rsquo;s ridiculous to think that we won&rsquo;t turn up things that we don&rsquo;t like, but we need the message to be: we&rsquo;re all in this together. We need to make sure that transparency doesn&rsquo;t become a political weapon, or &ldquo;out of an abundance of caution,&rdquo; we&rsquo;ll abandon the mission before it has a chance to succeed.</p>
