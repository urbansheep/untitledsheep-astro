<h3>Activity lulz</h3>

<p>So, we&rsquo;re having a hilarious time at the write-in here.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m seriously ahead of most of my WriMos, and I set a word war where the length of time was how long it took for me to finish my bagel. Then another one where they wordwarred to the time it took for me to eat half a brownie.</p>

<p>Then we had our longest word war yet: it started when one of our WriMos went to get a bagel sandwich. The length of time? From when he sat down to when the waiter delivered the sandwich. XD It was very tense, since we had no idea when the sandwich would arrive, and when it did I was all like &ldquo;THE BAGEL&rsquo;S HERE! STOP!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So what kind of activity lulz have you guys been having at your write-ins?</p>
