<blockquote>
<p>Craig Barrett: “Good teachers are magic”</p>

<p>In its schools, Finland has computers, but typically not in the one-PC-to-one-pupil ratio that is being tried in parts of the United States. Instead, the real Finnish edge seems to lie elsewhere — with high expectations and respected teachers. In his 2007 book “Innovation Nation: How America is Losing its Innovation Edge, Why It Matters and What We Can Do to Get It Back,” John Kao writes: “Finns have come to cherish gifted educators as Texans do ace quarterbacks. The country’s teacher training schools have 10 applicants for every opening.”</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett, whose company promotes the use of computers in schools, takes a similar view. “PCs aren’t magic,” he said. “Good teachers are.”</p>
