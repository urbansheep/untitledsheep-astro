As Torrone said in an email, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine doing a book, a video, a magazine unless I had a community that would rally along the way. In the end it always seemed to be about a story, people like to see the beginning, middle, end and plot of something &ndash; and if there&rsquo;s a buy button somewhere, they sometimes click it and reward us for working hard.&rdquo;
