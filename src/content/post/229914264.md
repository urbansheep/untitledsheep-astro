<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday in Physics someone&rsquo;s phone went off to the tune of the Justice League. After the professor paused his lecture to acknowledge the phone, the kid answered his phone and replied, &ldquo;The University is in trouble?! We&rsquo;re on our way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kid stood up, ripped off his t-shirt, revealed the Superman costume underneath, and exclaimed &ldquo;Super Friends, Assemble!&rdquo; Scattered across the class of about 150, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Green Lantern, and Flash all stood up and promptly left the class to save Auburn University.</p>
