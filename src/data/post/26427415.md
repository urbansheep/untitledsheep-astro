<blockquote>
<p>Working with the Fallout IP is actually something that fits very well with my own personal style as an artist. For a long time I have had a fascination with ruined and abandoned structures. So being able to create an entire world filled with things like that is the best thing I could ask for. The fact that the style was pre-existing is pretty much irrelevant, because if I was left to my own devices to make art, it would look exactly like <em>Fallout</em>. When I was working at Retro Studios on <em>Metroid Prime 3</em>, my friend Joel Burgess told me over and over how I needed to come to Bethesda to work on <em>Fallout 3</em> because I was “born to make this game.”</p>
