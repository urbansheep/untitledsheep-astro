<blockquote>
<h2>Слово дня: Gaydar</h2>
<p>Gaydar is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of <em>gay</em> and <em>radar</em> and refers to the reportedly intuitive ability to assess someone&rsquo;s sexual orientation as gay, bisexual, or straight. The function of gaydar relies on usually non-verbal sensory information and intuitions. These include the sensitivity to social behaviours and mannerisms; for instance, acknowledging flamboyant mannerisms, overtly rejecting traditional gender roles, a person&rsquo;s occupation and grooming habits.</p>

<p>The idea of gaydar is complicated by gay people not acting in a stereotypically “gay” fashion; also by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrosexual">metrosexual</a> men (regardless of sexuality) who seem to have heightened aesthetic senses and exhibit a lifestyle, spending habits and concern for personal appearance close enough to the stereotype of a fashionable urban gay man. ABC News&rsquo; 20/20 reported that gaydar does exist but it may work better for gay people and those who pay attention to issues around sexual orientation because they have more invested in knowing if someone is gay.</p>
