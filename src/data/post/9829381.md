<p>When I see that my friend Misha is &ldquo;waiting at Genius Bar to send my MacBook to the shop,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s not much information. But when I get such granular updates every day for a month, I know a lot more about her. And when my four closest friends and worldmates send me dozens of updates a week for five months, I begin to develop an almost telepathic awareness of the people most important to me.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like proprioception, your body&rsquo;s ability to know where your limbs are. That subliminal sense of orientation is crucial for coordination: It keeps you from accidentally bumping into objects, and it makes possible amazing feats of balance and dexterity.</p>
