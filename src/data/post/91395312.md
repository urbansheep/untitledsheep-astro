<blockquote>
<p>You should ignore your fans as well.</p>

<p>Your fans don&rsquo;t want you to change, your fans want you to maintain the essence of what you bring them but add a laundry list of features. You fans want lower prices and more contributions, bigger portions and more frequent deliveries.</p>

<p>So, who should you listen to?</p>

<p>Your sneezers.</p>

<p>You should listen to the people who tell the most people about you. <strong style="font-size:1.4em;">Listen to the people who thrive on sharing your good works with others.</strong> If you delight these people, you grow.</p>
