<blockquote>
<p>One of Burrel&rsquo;s favorite expressions was “I&rsquo;ll be your best friend”. He offered “best friendship” for a wide range of activities, like making some change in the software for him or getting him a Coke from the gas station. “Best friendship takes place”, he would declare if pleased with the results. He also had a habit of reducing things to initials, like &ldquo;B.F.R.&rdquo; for “Best Friendship Relationship”.</p>

<p>Once, right after Burrell conferred best friendship upon me, I heard him offer best friendship to someone else, for a different favor. “Wait a second”, I challenged Burrell, “How can you give out best friendship to someone else? There can be only one best friend at a time, can&rsquo;t there?”</p>

<p>Burrell had a quick reply, delivered with a smile. “Of course there can be only one “best” friend at a given instant of time. But best friendship relationships may be highly dynamic. <big>The average length of a best friendship is three to five milliseconds. So there&rsquo;s no problem in having a new B.F.R. a second or two later.”</big></p>
