<blockquote>
<p>Thousands of shoes, boots, slippers, sandals, and even roller blades from sources unknown disrupted Miami traffic on Friday. No witnesses have come forward with information on the <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/breaking-news/story/834846.html">mountain of footwear</a> and law enforcement officials say the person responsible for leaving behind the shoes will be charged for the clean up. I think we have just witnessed the beginning of the next M. Night Shyamalan movie.</p>
