<blockquote>
<p>WWDC has an <em>energy</em>. It’s a huge rally to juice developers’ confidence and enthusiasm for the platform. Every year, I’ve been filled with an insatiable desire to just <em>make something</em> the whole time, and that energy gives me a boost for months afterward.</p>

<p>The reason we all want to go so badly is because <em>it’s great</em>.</p>

<p>When you go, you’ve allocated that week to learning this stuff. That’s your only job. You leave most of your workplace and family obligations behind for a week so you can spend all day in sessions, meeting great friends and colleagues in the industry, and immersing yourself in the technology, community, and culture.</p>
