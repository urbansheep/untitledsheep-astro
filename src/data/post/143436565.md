<blockquote>
<p>Later that night I would sit down at a 10 dollar table at the Bellagio next to a grumpy businessman from Guadalajara, put down 100 dollars, and proceed to lose all of my chips in approximately 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Whoa. I don’t know blackjack.</p>
<p>By memorizing the chart in the spirit of The Matrix learning paradigm, I had actually made things harder than they needed to be.</p>
<p>Blackjack requires “know-that” or declarative knowledge — I <i>know that</i> I should always split Aces and 8s. In contrast, kung-fu requires “know-how” or procedural knowledge — Keanu Reeves <i>knows how</i> to do a triple-kick in the air.</p>
<p>One of the key differences between the two is that while procedural knowledge needs to be wired in the brain, you can essentially “<a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-10/st_thompson">outsource</a>” declarative knowledge to your computer, your hard drive, or a little blackjack card. This is a good thing, because it means that your brain can devote more energy to the important stuff (like finding the waitress and ordering another free drink).</p>
