<p>Since I never can settle for simple-but-not-yet-there interfaces, I decided to collect a short list of things that I would like to improve on.</p>
<h3>Shortcuts in the linkbar</h3>
<p><img src="http://urbansheep.ru/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/2007-03-10_013907.png" border="0" alt="It's already there! Why not make it better?"/></p>

<p>Number one feature for always-around type of user is instant access to editing via small linkbar with links to sign out and &ldquo;publish&rdquo; section. It&rsquo;s great, but lacks links to instant posting. Yeah, those:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/new/regular">Regular Post</a> | 
    <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/publisher/new/photo">Photo</a> |
    <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/publisher/new/quote">Quote</a> |
    <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/publisher/new/link">Link</a> |
    <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/publisher/new/conversation">Conversation</a> |
    <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/publisher/new/video">Video</a></p>

<p>So I suppose that linkbar in the screenshot above could be somewhat improved with those links placed instead of &ldquo;Add/Edit link&rdquo; (which could be consequently renamed to &ldquo;Edit/Settings&rdquo;). Less clicks to post — happier blogger. No?</p>

<h3>Documentation!</h3>

<p>Tumblr is great in many ways (especially great for its simplicity and fo so much automagic inside), but I miss some helpful hints: about using different things in theme template (<s>how many date formats are there? How does the whole post/date looping work?</s> Etc.) and about defaults such as HTML filtering (can we have the list of what&rsquo;s going the way of dodo? Filtering seemingly filters out perfectly normal H3 tags so I had to turn it off for myself).</p>

<p>Some tutorials or some blog posts about advanced usage and techniques would be great, but I guess you guys at Davidville would consider it an overkill&hellip;</p>

<p>UPD: Oh well, there&rsquo;s already <strong>some nice progress</strong> on <a href="http://tumblr.com/custom_themes">custom themes documentation</a>!</p>

<h3>Smoothed edges</h3>
<p>There are also some minor things (no links to homepage/FAQ from /publisher* pages, no table of contents in FAQ for quick scanning, no form of feedback for signed-in users - it would be more fun than email, <s>featured blogs section on the homepage is kind of short, so I have to refer to <a href="http://blog.davidville.com/2007/03/06/mobile-uploads/">blog</a> for more samples) which also could be improved</s> (already <a href="http://blog.davidville.com/2007/03/06/we-hear-you/">in the works</a> along with other cool stuff, and started to come true as <a href="http://tumblr.com/radar">Tumblr Radar</a>), but it&rsquo;s more of a &ldquo;next thing to do after we&rsquo;re done&rdquo; and an icing on the cake. I could really use link to the homepage, but FAQ isn&rsquo;t of much use to me now as it&rsquo;s quite hollow after I got thru the first several stages/steps.</p>

<h3>External access</h3>
<p>As good as planned API might be, support of Metaweblog API or Atom might enable users to come with their favourite blog-clients, which might help to make posting even more convinient. Link post types to the &ldquo;categories&rdquo; in metaweblog api, and everything should work without any issues, I guess.</p>

<p>Some other stuff (added here as I find new stuff of note):</p>
<ul><li>In the theme preview there&rsquo;s no prev/next paging link example. (Increase number of test posts or decrease number of blogs per page for preview?)</li>
<li>Page titles are all the same (for /publisher and all — otherwise all the open tabs in browser seem to be the same faceless &ldquo;Tumblr&rdquo;: Tumblr, again Tumbler, yet again Tumbler. And browser history is all the same — whether it was homepage or settings, post text or post link — they are absolutely all the same.</li>
</ul>
