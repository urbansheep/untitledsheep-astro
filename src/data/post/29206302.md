<blockquote>
I think some bloggers call it “strategy tax.” <strong style="font-size:1.4em;">You know, when you grow, your strategy becomes more and more important, and it taxes sort of everything you do a little bit&hellip;</strong> because everything you do, it strays from that strategy. You know, there’s a huge cost to that. Whereas I think for smaller companies, the strategy is less well-defined, or certainly the impact of straying from it is much lower.
