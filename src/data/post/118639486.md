<blockquote>
And when it was all over, one of the other assistant coaches came over and said, yeah, Coach Graham rode you pretty hard, didn&rsquo;t he? I said, yeah. He said, that&rsquo;s a good thing. He said, when you&rsquo;re screwing up and nobody&rsquo;s saying anything to you anymore, that means they gave up. And that&rsquo;s a lesson that stuck with me my whole life: <strong>when you see yourself doing something badly and nobody&rsquo;s bothering to tell you anymore, that&rsquo;s a very bad place to be. Your critics are your ones telling you they still love you and care.</strong>
